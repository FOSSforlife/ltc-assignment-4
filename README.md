# OpenSesame Catalog Analysis

This is a Node.js script that tells you how many hours (or days) it would take to complete every course in the OpenSesame Catalog!

## Instructions

### Editing the Code

1. Open the [index.js](index.js) file and copy all of the code into the [Online Node.js Compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_nodejs_online.php).
2. Modify the code so that it contains accurate numbers for the [OpenSesame Catalog](https://www.opensesame.com/online-training-courses/search) and calculates the number of hours that it would take to complete every single course.
3. To test your code, click the "Execute" button in the top left.

### Submitting the Code

Once your code is ready, you'll want to create your own GitHub repository for it.

1. Make sure you are logged into your GitHub account.
2. Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (basically a clone) of this repository by following the "Forking a repository" steps in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo?tool=webui#forking-a-repository).
3. On your forked repository, open the index.js file and click the "edit" icon (looks like a pencil).
4. Replace this with your working code from the Online Node.js Compiler.
5. Send me the URL for your repository in Slack so I can verify it! :tada:
